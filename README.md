**Student:** Yogaraj Kumaresan  
**Module:** Next Generation Data Science (NGDS)  
**Institution:** University of Hertfordshire  
**Tutor:** Wong Kim Siong  

## Project Overview
End-to-end machine learning pipeline for credit card fraud detection using the ULB Credit Card Fraud dataset (Kaggle).

## Contents
- `NGDS_Assignment1_.ipynb` — Main Colab notebook

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload `creditcard.csv` from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
3. Run all cells from top to bottom

## Pipeline Summary
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Preprocessing (SMOTE, RobustScaler)
3. Model 1 — Random Forest Classifier
4. Model 2 — Logistic Regression
5. AutoML — 6-model comparison
6. Hyperparameter Tuning (RandomizedSearchCV)
7. Final Evaluation (AUPRC, ROC-AUC, F1, MCC)
8. Explainable AI — SHAP Analysis
